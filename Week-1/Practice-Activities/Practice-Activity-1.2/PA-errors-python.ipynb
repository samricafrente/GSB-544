Don't despair!  Errors (when R is unable to run your code) and bugs (when the code doesn't do what you hoped) are a natural part of coding.  Even the best of the best deal with these problems regularly - learning to track down the issue is a skill that you can learn and practice.\n","\n","Google is your friend!  If an error is confusing, copy it into Google and see what other people are saying.  If you don't know how to do something, search for it.\n","\n","### Hint 2\n","\n","Just because there is no error message doesn't mean everything went smoothly.  You should be regularly printing out your objects, to see they contain the information and format that you expect.\n","\n","For example, if you have an object named `my_thing`, you might first want to simply look at the object by typing its name.\n","\n","However, you might also want to make sure it is the right **object type** and/or the right **object structure**.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":217,"status":"ok","timestamp":1727279280444,"user":{"displayName":"Sam Ricafrente","userId":"02470996150362458463"},"user_tz":420},"id":"D5pSzgxjrrqq","outputId":"6eb4ef9f-68b8-43be-d09d-6cecd5e6eadb","vscode":{"languageId":"python"}},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["6"]},"execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["my_thing = \"LeBron\"\n","type(my_thing)\n","len(my_thing)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QpUJsmq0rrqr"},"source":["## Part One: Setup\n","\n","Each of the following code chunks will cause an error and/or do the desired task incorrectly.
